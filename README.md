# Overview

This project involves data modeling, engineering, and analysis for a company's employee database. The primary tasks include creating an entity-relationship diagram (ERD), developing SQL table schemas based on CSV file data, and performing various data analysis queries.

# Data Engineering

Table Schema Creation:
- Create SQL table schemas for each CSV file.
- Defining primary keys. Use composite keys if a single primary key is not sufficient.
- Set foreign keys and ensure referential integrity.

Database Setup:
- Executing SQL scripts to create tables in the correct order, respecting foreign key dependencies.

Data Import:
- Importing data from the CSV files into the corresponding SQL tables.
- Ensuring data is correctly mapped and imported.

# Data Modeling

- Inspecting the provided CSV files to understand the data structure.
- Sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using a tool like QuickDBD.
- The ERD clearly shows the tables, their relationships, primary keys, and foreign keys.

# Data Analysis

Perform SQL queries to retrieve specific information:

- Listing employee details including employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
- Listing employees hired in 1986.
- Listing department managers with department details.
- Listing employees along with their department details.
- Listing employees named Hercules with a last name starting with 'B'.
- Listing all employees in the Sales department.
- Listing all employees in Sales and Development departments.
- Generating a frequency count of employee last names in descending order.
